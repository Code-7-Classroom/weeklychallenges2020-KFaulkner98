//VERY EASY: What is the difference between the following JavaScript keywords: var, let and const.  Please provide a written explanation. 
//You are able to include a code reference along with your written explanation for each keyword.

//Variables allow us to label data and store it in memory. We us the keyword 'var' for variables. The keyowrds 'let' and 'const' 
//are used in ES6, and replace the keyowrd 'var'. 'Let' is only accessible in the block level it is defined, while 
//'const' is used to assign a constant value to the variable, and the file is fixed.


//EASY: Using ES6 syntax, write a function that takes in an array of numbers and outputs the maximum number.
const newArry = [1, 2, 3, 4]
console.log(Math.max(...newArry));
