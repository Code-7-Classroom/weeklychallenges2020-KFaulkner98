// Very Easy
// Create two variables and assign a number to each
// Console log the difference between the numbers
// Example output: "The difference between 6 and 2 is 4"
var num1 = 6;
var num2 = 2;
var difference = num1 - num2;
console.log(num1 - num2)
console.log('The difference between ' + num1 + ' and ' + num2 + ' is ' + difference)

// Easy
//  Create two variables and assign a person’s name to each. 
// Console log a statement that says which name is shorter or longer, and by how many characters.   
// Example output: “The name Thomas is longer than John by 2 characters”  
var firstName = "Kyle";
var secondName = "Antonio";
console.log('The name ' + secondName + ' is longer than ' + firstName + ' by 3 characters.')
